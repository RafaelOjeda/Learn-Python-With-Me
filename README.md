Hello everyone, 

I am currently in college studying Computer Science. I am teaching myself Python mainly using the book called "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. 

This is what you would call my notebook for everything Python that I learn whether it be from the book or an online course. I also will have projects (possibly in another repository) that I do as part of the learning process. Something else that I will be learning is Git along with Markdown just to get used to this whole Github thing. My goal is to be able to make this a resource for everyone. Which is why I am asking for any person whether it be beginner or professonal programmer to pitch in (because I can't cover a whole language specially if I am learning as well). Teach everyone something you know and make this be like a dictionary for Python. 



I am writting all of this using VSCode and will put any resources that I use to learn new things down below.

Thank you for reading. If you'd like to contact me please email me at rafael.e.ojeda@gmail.com
